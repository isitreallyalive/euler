# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Problem

- [Link to the problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
